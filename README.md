# File-sharing-with-ftp-server.
Is a program that allows you to share files with a remote ftp server. It does the same thing as Filezilla.

It is a simple file sharing system. When it works in your program, it will create a folder called Transfer2 on your desktop. 
Once you have access to the server, drag the files you want to transfer to the Transfer2 folder on the desktop.
